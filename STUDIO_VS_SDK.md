# Tableland Studio vs SDK Tables

## Understanding the Difference

**Tableland Studio** and **Tableland SDK** are two different ways to interact with Tableland:

### Studio-Created Tables
- Created through Studio's web interface
- Appear in Studio's "Definitions" section
- Tracked and managed by Studio
- Can use Project ID and Environment ID

### SDK-Created Tables  
- Created directly on-chain via SDK
- Fully functional and accessible
- May not appear in Studio's Definitions immediately
- Still queryable via SDK, Validator API, or Studio Console

## Your Current Situation

✅ **Table Created:** `transactions_8453_26`
✅ **Table Works:** Verified and accessible via SDK
⚠️ **Not in Studio:** Doesn't appear in Definitions section

## Solutions

### Option 1: Use Studio Console (Easiest)
1. Go to Studio → Console
2. Query your table directly:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM transactions_8453_26;
   ```
3. The table works, just not tracked in Definitions

### Option 2: Create New Table via Studio
1. Go to Studio → Definitions
2. Click "Create Definition"
3. Use the same schema
4. Update `TABLELAND_TABLE_NAME` in `.env.local` with new table name
5. This table will appear in Definitions

### Option 3: Keep Using SDK Table
- Your current setup works perfectly
- Table is on-chain and accessible
- Just won't show in Studio's Definitions section
- You can still query it via Studio Console

## Recommendation

Since your table is already working, you have two choices:

1. **Keep using `transactions_8453_26`** - It works, just not visible in Definitions
2. **Create a new table via Studio** - Will appear in Definitions, but you'll need to migrate data

The table functionality is the same either way - Studio's Definitions is just a management interface.
