## 🚀 How to Activate (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
pnpm install
```

### Step 2: Query for Vaults
```bash

- [ ] Verify vault address on Basescan
- [ ] Test deposit with small amount (1 USDC)
- [ ] Test withdrawal with maxLoss = 1%
- [ ] Verify share calculations are correct
- [ ] Check error handling (insufficient balance, etc.)
- [ ] Test on mobile devices
- [ ] Verify transaction links work
- [ ] Monitor first production transactions

## 🎓 Key Learnings & Best Practices

### 1. Use `redeem()` over `withdraw()`
Yearn recommends the redeem function for withdrawals.

### 2. Always include `maxLoss`
Essential for protecting users during withdrawals:
```typescript
vault.redeem(shares, receiver, owner, 100) // 1% max loss
```

### 3. Use ERC-4626 functions for pricing
- ✅ Use: `convertToShares()` / `convertToAssets()`
- ❌ Avoid: `pricePerShare()` (precision loss)

### 4. Check limits before transactions
```typescript
const maxDeposit = await vault.maxDeposit(user);
const maxRedeem = await vault.maxRedeem(user);
```

### 5. Handle BigInt carefully
Use `BigInt()` constructor instead of `0n` literals for compatibility.

## 🆘 Common Issues & Solutions

### "No vaults found"
**Cause:** Yearn V3 not yet deployed on Base  
**Solution:** Wait for deployment, monitor Yearn Discord/Twitter

### "Transaction reverts"
**Cause:** MaxLoss too restrictive  
**Solution:** Increase maxLoss to 100 bps (1%) or higher

### "Approval fails"
**Cause:** Insufficient USDC or gas  
**Solution:** Verify balances, ensure ETH for gas

### "Share calculation incorrect"
**Cause:** Wrong decimals (6 for USDC, 18 for shares)  
**Solution:** Verify `assetDecimals` prop
